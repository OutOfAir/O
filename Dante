What is the difference between fame and its synonyms, power and popularity? Popularity is the local consolidation of fame, which may or may not overlap on the stage; it asserts the proximate as a necessary site of contact, and attaches no specific tangible capital to the person whose qualities imply they have ‘power.’ The heuristic of mental health rejects these relations by the recognition that their effect is based on the dynamics of unrequited love, the unsexing of relation. To say the president didn’t exploit this fact by disgracing his intern is not to absolve him.
Is the social drive to unscrew the imposition of power possible to meet in mimesis?  The American pilgrims placed their faith in books by Catholic icons, suggesting a man making his worth as an artist today may be an author or a sculptor based on how he finds the premise of pilgrimage. Visual artists write the book as body; authors draw it as a figure… Only women still read however, and isn’t that because their literacy comes later.  
So, someone told Susan Sontag, I'm a writer, not a reader?  And he was a knighted Brit from Trinidad?
